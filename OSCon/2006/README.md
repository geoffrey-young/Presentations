# OSCon 2005

Talks I presented at [The O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/).

## Power PHP Testing

*Power PHP Testing* was a 3 hour, in-depth tutorial co-presented with Chris Shiflett

### Description

Admit it, you know you should be testing your PHP applications. However, with all of the different PHP test environments and the daunting documentation, sometimes it's difficult to know where to start. This tutorial will help. We begin by offering a very simple PHP application with identifying elements that lend themselves to testing. We'll write some real tests using several of the existing PHP testing tools, including PHPUnit, Simple-Test, phpt, and Apache-Test.

In all fairness, we're biased--we think Apache-Test is simply the best testing environment for PHP applications, offering a rich set of test-writing tools while also providing a pristine, self-contained, and automated testing environment.

The bulk of the tutorial will be spent learning how to write tests using Apache-Test and exactly what it means to have such a powerful tool at your fingertips. Along the way, you'll be learning standard, insightful testing idioms that are universally helpful, regardless of the framework or even the language being used. You will leave this tutorial with some real-world testing skills that you will find immediately applicable to your day-to-day PHP work. And, you'll have some fun, too.

## Rock Your Testing World with Devel::Cover

*Rock Your Testing World with Devel::Cover* was a standard, one hour presentation.

### Description

So great, you've elevated your Perl game to a new level by using Test::More, prove, and automated testing. Do you know what percentage of your code your tests actually exercise? Devel::Cover is an outstanding testing tool that needs to be part of every Perl developer's toolbox. This talk will introduce Devel::Cover and explain how to use it effectively using simple code examples from the real world. It will end with some advanced techniques illustrating how Devel::Cover not only can provide coverage, but can also be an incredibly helpful debugging and code development tool.
