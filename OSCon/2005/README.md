# OSCon 2005

Talks I presented at [The O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2005](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/).

## Test-Driven Apache Module Development

*Test-Driven Apache Module Development* was a 3 hour, in-depth tutorial.

### Description

Writing tests is up there with documentation as the thing we coders dread the most, but for Apache developers it doesn't need to be that way. With the Apache-Test framework, the engine behind much of the httpd-test project, testing your code can be more exciting than writing it! Imagine a world where your Apache module contains a full suite of integrated tests that even your boss can run--it's self-documenting fun!

In this session, participants will learn about using the Apache-Test toolkit to:

 - Issue a single command that will configure Apache, start the server, run your tests, shutdown the server, and issue a success report
 - Test against 1.3, 2.0, or 2.1 Apache server installations
 - Use the test framework to automatically compile and configure Apache C modules
 - Write simple test scripts that mimic client behaviors
 - Examine basic testing principles to help methodically guide test writing
 - Impress your boss, get a raise, make new friends

If you develop or maintain Apache modules in either C or Perl then this is one session you can't afford to miss.

## A Few Cool Things About mod_perl 2.0

*A Few Cool Things About mod_perl 2.0* was a standard, one hour presentation.

### Description

mod_perl 2.0 is certainly a lot to digest. But hidden deep in the recesses of this new release are lots of features that you won't find at the forefront of the typical "why mod_perl 2.0" discussion but which are super cool. Oh, and they are important to your migration strategy too. This session outlines a few of the important but lesser known features of mod_perl 2.0 that will get you thinking in new directions as you migrate away from mod_perl 1.0.
