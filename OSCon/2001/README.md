Talks I presented at [The O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2001](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/oscon/)

## Transitioning to mod_perl Handlers

*Transitioning to mod_perl Handlers* was a 3 hour, in-depth tutorial.

### Description

So, you have managed to port all of your existing CGI scripts to work under mod_perl and Apache::Registry. Now what? In this session we will start harnessing the real power of mod_perl and introduce handlers as a means to take advantage of the Apache API and request phases, improve performance, and allow for greater developer flexibility. Direct examination of handlers that integrate tightly with the Apache request cycle, such as uri translation, authentication, and filtered content generation will be presented. Strategies for migrating an application from Apache::Registry to handlers, such as using Apache::Dispatch and a brief look at a world without CGI.pm will also be covered.
