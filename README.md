# Presentations Given By Geoffrey Young

Back in the early days of dot-com, when the P in LAMP was Perl, I spent a lot of time in the Open Source arena, created some of the software that made many 
of those dot-com companies tick, and educated others on how to get the most from it.  This repository holds many of the presentations I have given to the Open Source community from 2001 through 2010.

Enjoy!
