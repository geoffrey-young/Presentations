## Digital Storytelling: The Evolution of Publishing Fiction on a Mobile Device

*Digital Storytelling: The Evolution of Publishing Fiction on a Mobile Device* was a standard, one hour presentation.

### Description

Today’s mobile devices are insanely powerful, offering a fully
programmable interface for ebook publishing over and above just presenting
pages on a screen. Given all this power and flexibility, what kind of story
can you tell? How can you immerse your readers? What can a truly digital
story look like when the publishing medium has full-time internet access, the
reader’s location, and can be programmed page by page? What if a story is
treated as software in addition to fiction?

This talk will examine a novel publishing experiment – a full graphic novel
published exclusively on an iPhone that uses email, SMS, geolocation, and
more to pull each reader into their own version of the story over the course
of 10 days. More than a glossy look at a work of fiction, we will
discuss concepts within the story and publication platform that immerse
readers and which can be applied to other digital stories. We will also
examine concrete statistics such as user retention and usage patterns,
and whether the combination of statistics and real user feedback judges the
project a publishing success.
