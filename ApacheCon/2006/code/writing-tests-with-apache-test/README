this is the code from "Writing Tests with Apache-Test",
a tutorial given at ApacheCon 2006

each directory holds a self-contained code example from the
tutorial.  to run the tests just cd to the proper directory
then issue the following:

  $ perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

if your built Apache as a DSO, or

  $ perl Makefile.PL -httpd /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd

if you built it statically.

then, just run

  $ make
  $ make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and you should be on your way.

to run all the examples, just follow the same path without
changing to a specific directory first.
