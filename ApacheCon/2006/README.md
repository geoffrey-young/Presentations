# ApacheCon US 2006

Talks I presented at [ApacheCon US 2006](http://www.apachecon.com/2006/US/html/sessions.html)

## Writing Tests with Apache-Test

*Writing Tests with Apache-Test* was a 3 hour, in-depth tutorial.

### Description

Tests make your life easier, and Apache::Test makes writing tests that execute against a live webserver easy - it takes care of configuring and starting the server, running your tests, stopping the server, and reporting back your successes (or failures). This talk will introduce the Apache-Test interface and detail what you need to know to get started.

## Output Filters with mod_perl 2.0

*Output Filters with mod_perl 2.0* was a standard, one hour presentation.

### Description

One of the more interesting and practical features to come out of the Apache 2.0 redesign effort is output filters. While mod_perl has had the ability to filter content for years, it wasn't until Apache 2.0 that we could truly leverage that power to its full extent. Here, we will introduce the new and simple streaming API and show how powerful just a few simple lines of mod_perl can be.
