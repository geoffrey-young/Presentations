this is the code from "Test-Driven Apache Module Development",
a tutorial given at ApacheCon 2004.

each directory holds a self-contained code example from the
tutorial.  to run the tests just cd to the proper directory
then issue the following:

  $ perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

if your built Apache as a DSO, or

  $ perl Makefile.PL -httpd /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd

if you built it statically.

then, just run

  $ make
  $ make test TEST_VERBOSE=1

and you should be on your way.  if you do not have Apache-Test 
installed, you can use the copy provided in this tarball (1.16).
a simple

  $ export PERL5LIB=/path/to/T07-2004-code/Apache-Test/lib

ought to do the trick.

the original tutorial presentation can be found here

  http://www.modperlcookbook.org/~geoff/slides/ApacheCon/2004/T07-2004.pdf

at the end of the tutorial are links to helpful documentation,
articles, etc, so check there if you need additional pointers.
