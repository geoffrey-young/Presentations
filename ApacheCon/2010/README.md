## Implementing Apache Solr at Ticketmaster: a Case Study

*Implementing Apache Solr at Ticketmaster: a Case Study* was a standard, one hour presentation.

### Description

Ticketmaster has a very large and legacy-heavy codebase, so the decision to abandon our custom search solution on favor of a Lucene should have been a disaster. However, despite the numerous complex and non-standard requirements of our business, migrating to Solr was successful at almost every level. How did Ticketmaster handle multilingual support, daily index rebuilds, and searches for "Circus Olay" in 6 months with 4 engineers? Apache Solr and some moxie. Come find out the gory details of our Solr implementation and what makes Ticketmaster search tick.
