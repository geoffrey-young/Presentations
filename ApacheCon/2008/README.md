## Perlformance: The Art and Science of Tuning a Large Perl Application

*Perlformance: The Art and Science of Tuning a Large Perl Application* was a 3 hour, in-depth tutorial.

### Description

Like most large websites, ticketmaster.com contains a lot of code, spread across proxies, cache systems, databases, black boxes, etc. At the heart of it all more than 400,000 lines of custom Perl code spread across more than 1500perl modules. Keeping that much code optimized for performance is no easy task - all code has bottlenecks, but the trick is figuring out where they (really) are. "Premature optimization is the root of all evil... the ability to accurately determine what is premature separates great developers from merely capable ones."

This session will introduce basic code profiling concepts and the Perl tools that savvy developers use every day, enabling them to properly identify optimization opportunities in their code. From there, we will advance into the profiling techniques used to tune ticketmaster.com, which you will be able to apply to your own Perl-based applications. In all, you will leave with the knowledge you need to bring your Perl coding skills to the next level.
