## A Few Cool Things About mod_perl 2.0

*A Few Cool Things About mod_perl 2.0* was a standard, one hour presentation.

### Description

mod_perl 2.0 is certainly a lot to digest. But hidden deep in the recesses of this new release are lots of features that you won't find at the forefront of the typical "why mod_perl 2.0" discussion but which are super cool. Oh, and they are important to your migration strategy too. This session outlines a few of the important but lesser known features of mod_perl 2.0 that will get you thinking in new directions as you migrate away from mod_perl 1.0.
