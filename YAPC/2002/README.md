# YAPC 2002

Talks I presented at [Yet Another Perl Conference 2002](http://yapc.org/America/previous-years/2002/)

## mod_perl: do more

### Description

*mod_perl: do more* was a standard one hour presentation.

OSCon theme this year is doing more with less.  If you ask Joe Developer what mod_perl is, he quacks "It's basically just faster CGI."  That's not exactly right...

This talk shows how you can use mod_perl to not only do more with less but actually do more.

## Object Oriented mod_perl

*Object Oriented mod_perl* was a standard one hour presentation.

### Description

One of the greatest benefits of using the mod_perl handler API is the ability to leverage the power of object-oriented programming techniques within your application using mod_perl's concept of method handlers. Since mod_perl handlers are just subroutines contained within a package namespace, your existing handlers already have most of the components required of Perl's object-oriented model: a class and a method. With a few additional steps, you can turn your ordinary handlers in to method handlers, opening up enormous opportunities. With object-oriented design, you can subclass existing classes, changing only the methods whose features do not fit your needs.

## Directive Handlers with mod_perl

*Directive Handlers with mod_perl* was a standard one hour presentation.

### Description

Directive handlers are a very powerful but little used feature of mod_perl.  This talk will show how you can use directive handlers to make Apache bend to your will.
